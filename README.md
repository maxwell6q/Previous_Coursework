Selection of Previous Academic Coursework

## Bachelor's Thesis
My bachelor's thesis on  Windmodeling and Control of Electric Urban Air Vehicles and the corresponding MATLAB and Simulink files.


## Computer Vision
Includes the repository for a midterm group project to introduce the concept of Object Recognition and familiarize with the use of Features. The project is worth 0.5/30 credits.
A final group project for Visual Odometry is currently in development.


## Estimation and Filtering
An optional homework implementing a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo estimation to estimate system parameters of a COVID-19 epidemics model.


## Control Engineering Lab
For the course, four lab-practicals on different control approaches were prepared and conducted, and a final report was written for one lab, selected by the teacher's choice.
For the labs, a servo motor with various load and disturbance conditions and a balancing robot were modelled, and different continuous and discrete-time control approaches were compared using the real motor and robot. The final report details the design and implementation of digital controllers.


## Quantum Information and Computing
The course introduced quantum-mechanical principles and their applications to communication and computing setups. The repository includes a homework on the basic principles and a lab report on proving entanglement and state tomography.
