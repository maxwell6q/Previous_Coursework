# Previous_Coursework
Selection of Previous Academic Coursework and [my current transcript of records](/PriesMaximilian_Transcript_0725.pdf).

## Bachelor's Thesis
Wind Modeling and Control of Electric Urban Air Vehicles, including related MATLAB and Simulink files.


## Computer Vision
Includes a midterm group project introducing object recognition using feature-based methods (0.5/30 credits). A final group project on visual odometry is currently in progress.

## Estimation and Filtering
An optional homework implementing a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo estimation to estimate system parameters of a COVID-19 epidemics model.


## Control Engineering Lab
Four lab sessions were conducted on modelling and various control strategies using a servo motor and a balancing robot. The final report, selected by the instructor, details the design and implementation of digital controllers.


## Quantum Information and Computing
Includes a homework on quantum fundamentals and a lab report on entanglement verification and state tomography.


## Future Coursework
In the coming Fall Semester 25/26, I will participate in the following courses with anticipated projects/homework:
- Adaptive and Model Predictive Control: Homework on non-linear control using MATMPC
- Robotics and Control: Group project on distributed robotics using ROS2
- Intelligent Robotics: Group projects on path planning and identification using ROS2
- Reinforcement Learning: Project on robotics
